# price_checker

This is a simple price checking app that utilizes webscraping to look at specific
products on amazon. (You have to change the url in the code to whatever you want.)

You need to have headers in for bs4 to work. So just go to myhttpheader.com and paste the language and user-agent 
in the appropriate variables.

Go to camelcamelcamel.com to compare the lowest price of your product and then insert that into your if statement.

You'll also have to utilize pushover (or your own method) to send the alert to yourself.

I'm running this on a headless pi that I use to automate daily notifications and tasks so I can be lazy.

Enjoy!
